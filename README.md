# Transcriptomic Profiling of Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis

This repository presents a transcriptomic analysis comparing skin biopsies from patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), Psoriasis (PsO), and healthy controls. The goal is to identify gene expression differences that may enable earlier, non-invasive diagnosis of PsA using skin biopsies.

## üìÑ Files Included

- `PsO Project Report.pdf` ‚Äì Full report including all figures, tables, methods, and interpretation  
- `R_Markdown_DESeq2_GSE186063.pdf` ‚Äì RMarkdown output with code
- `PsO Project Presentation.pdf` ‚Äì Slide deck summarizing key findings for presentation  

## üîç Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Public RNA-seq data from GEO [GSE186063](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186063)  
- **Groups Compared**: Psoriasis (PsO), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS/CTL)  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Preprocessing: FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, HTSeq (via Galaxy)  
  - Analysis: DESeq2, DAVID, EnhancedVolcano, pheatmap  
  - Visualization: R/Bioconductor, BioRender  

## üß¨ Key Findings

- No DEGs between PsO and PsA skin lesions, indicating similar transcriptomic profiles  
- Both PsO and PsA show strong upregulation of keratinization and immune-related genes compared to controls  
- PsO uniquely enriched for genes involved in neurodegenerative pathways (e.g., Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs)  
- Elevated expression of **CALML5**, **CAMK2B**, and **CDK5R1** may indicate systemic effects beyond the skin

## üìÇ Contents
